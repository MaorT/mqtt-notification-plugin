    For finer grained control of which algorithm is used. Supported protocol values are:
<ul>
    <li>ssl:// - Use the JVM default version of the SSL algorithm.</li>
    <li>sslv*:// - Use a specific SSL version where * is a version supported by your JVM. Example: sslv3</li>
    <li>tls:// - Use the JVM default version of the TLS algorithm.</li>
    <li>tlsv*:// - Use a specific TLS version where * is a version supported by your JVM. Example: tlsv1.1</li>
</ul>
